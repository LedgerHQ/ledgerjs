# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

This repository hosts the `@ledgerhq/*` JavaScript libraries.

## JavaScript styleguide

* ES6+ features.
* [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting convention. You can run `npm
  run prettier`.
* ESLint is used to enhance code quality. Check with `yarn run lint`.
* TypeScript is used to typecheck the library. Check with `yarn build`.

> NB. for the 3 points above, the best is to have integration of Prettier,
> ESlint, Flowtype in your text editor (there are plugin for most editors).

## Documentation

* [documentation.js](https://documentation.js.org/) for generation markdown documentations of libraries. You can run `yarn doc`.
