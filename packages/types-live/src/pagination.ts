/**
 * A pagination config holds the user's pagination state
 * this is a state that usually should leave during the app lifecycle, but is not persisted
 * it drives the number of operations to poll in accounts
 * when a user paginate more, the number should accordingly be incremented
 * The UI should manage scrolling ahead of time (e.g. if 30 ops is displayed and UI have pages of 20 ops, the UI can already request to poll 70 ops so it have 2 pages in advance)
 * The UI must always do max() to keep the increasing the counter and not going back to lower value: that optim the sync to not recompute things too much
